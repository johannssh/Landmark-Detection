# Landmark Detection and Tracking

- Used feature detection and keypoint descriptors to build a map of the environment with SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping).
- Implemented a robust method for tracking an object over time using elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra.
- Employed localization techniques that are widely used in autonomous vehicle navigation.
